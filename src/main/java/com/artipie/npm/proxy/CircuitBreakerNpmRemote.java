/**
 * Decorate a {@link NpmRemote} with a {@link CircuitBreaker}.
 * @since 0.7
 * @todo #16:30min Wrap new instances of HttpNpmRemote with this class
 *  in NpmProxy. But first ensure that HttpNpmRemote throws an exception
 *  in case the request fails (it should still return Maybe for 404
 *  though). Also see https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-circuit-breaker/java/
 *  for configuring the CircuitBreaker.
 * @todo #16:30min Add a test to ensure it works as expected. The most simple
 *  is to provide a Fake version of NpmRemote that can be setup to either fail
 *  or work as expected by the contract of NpmRemote. Be careful about the fact
 *  that the expected behaviour is beasically: empty if the asset/package is not
 *  present and an exception if there is an error. See also the todo above or
 *  HttpNpmRemote if it had been solved already.
